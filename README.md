# repo contains build scripts for alpine linux
these are not to be expected to be maintained religiously, they are more intended if people have a use for the software since its not packaged by alpine, and i dont have the time to be the public maintainer for them.

### currently have scripts for: 
*  [simulton/gpds](https://github.com/simulton/gpds) 
*  [simulton/QSchematic](https://github.com/simulton/QSchematic) (depends on gpds above & qt6-qtbase)


the folder structure is intentional simulton as the outer folder, makes a simulton repo.

### to build use as reference [alpines tools](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Creating_an_Alpine_package) & [abuild and helpers](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Abuild_and_Helpers)
- to make life easier, check out [atools](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/v3.18/community/x86_64/atools) and [lua-aports](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86_64/lua-aports)
